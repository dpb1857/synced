Install, instructions from: https://www.dropbox.com/install-linux

-------------

1) Use headless install via command line;
   cd ~ && wget -O - "https://www.dropbox.com/download?plat=lnx.x86_64" | tar xzf -

2) Run the Dropbox daemon from the newly created .dropbox-dist folder
   ~/.dropbox-dist/dropboxd

   --> This prompts you to login to your dropbox account in a web page;

3) Download dropbox.py, from link on instructions page, copy to /usr/local/bin/dropbox;
   look here: https://help.dropbox.com/installs-integrations/desktop/linux-commands,
   under "What linux commands are available..."

3b) Use the GUI to exclude any directories that need it;
    the command line
      "dropbox exclude add ..." to exclude directories from sync;
    doesn't seem to exlude them.
    However,
       dropbox exclude list
    will show them.

4) To start dropbox:
     dropbox start -i
