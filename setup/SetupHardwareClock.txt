I recently faced the same problem and this is how I fixed it. You need to make some minor changes in both operating systems.

I started with Linux first. Run the following commands as root:

ntpdate pool.ntp.org
This will update your time if it is not set correctly.

Now set the hardware clock to UTC with this command.

utc

Now boot to Windows and add the following to the registry. Simply create a .reg file using the code below in Notepad. Save it and run it.

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\=dword:00000001
Source

From the next boot onward, both operating systems will show you the correct time.RealTimeIsUniversalTimeZoneInformation]
