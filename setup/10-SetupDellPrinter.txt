    sudo apt-get install libcupsimage2:i386

2)
    # (maybe?)
    sudo apt-get install lib32stdc++6 lib32z1

3)  # (maybe?)
    apt --fix-broken-install

4)
    Download and install the Ubuntu .deb drivers from Xerox for their Phaser 6000 model.
    https://www.support.xerox.com/en-gb/product/phaser-6000/downloads?language=en_GB&platform=linux

# [ I have it in Documents/DellC1760nw/xerox-phaser-6000-6010_1.0-1_i386.deb ]
#
# 16.10 extras: I had to download some additional stuff by hand from packages.ubuntu.com;
#
#   lib32stdc++6
#   lib32gcc1
#   libc6-i386
#
#   If you try to debug filter problems, look for "xrhkazmf" in the the
#   /var/log/cups/error_log file.
#
#
# 20.04, 22.04 extras:
#   these can be installed using apt.
#
#   lib32stdc++6
#   lib32z1
#
#   apt --fix-broken install
#
# does good things for pulling in remaining missing dependencies.
#
#
# Then:
#
#   sudo service cups restart
