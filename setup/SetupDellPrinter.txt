Basic Instructions -

sudo apt-get install libcupsimage2:i386
Download and install the Ubuntu .deb drivers from Xerox for their Phaser 6000 model.

[ I have it in Downloads/DellC1760nw/xerox-phaser-6000-6010_1.0-1_i386.deb ]

I had to download some additional stuff by hand from packages.ubuntu.com; for 16.10:

  lib32stdc++6
  lib32gcc1
  libc6-i386

If you try to debug filter problems, look for "xrhkazmf" in the the
/var/log/cups/error_log file.


20.04 extras:
  lib32stdc++6
  lib32z1

  sudo service cups restart
