Found it!

Preferences > System Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts tab > Custom Shortcuts

click "Add custom shortcut"

name: [whatever]
command: "xset dpms force off"

click the field below "Keyboard bindings" and set any key combination you want (i went for "Fn+F3" which gets shown as "XF86Battery")
